# **Resume Best Practices**

## **1. General Rules**

* **Tailor every resume** to the job. Use keywords from the description naturally.
* **Show impact, not tasks.** Every bullet = *action + result*, ideally quantified.
* **Use active voice + strong verbs.** No “responsible for”, no pronouns (“I”).
* **Be concise.** Keep only high-value content; remove fluff.
* **Keep only what is relevant to the job description.** Discard any content that does not add value to the job description. 
* **Error-free.** Zero typos, consistent formatting, clean structure.
* **ATS-friendly.** No tables, columns, images, text boxes, icons, or fancy bullets.
* **Be truthful.** Do not include fake achievements or experiences, or exaggerated claims. Always be faithful to the resume content.

## **2. Structure**

### **Header**

* Name
* Contact information: phone, email, LinkedIn, Website, GitHub, other.
* No photo, no personal data (do not add age, marital status, exact address instead of city or country).

### **Summary**

* Should be 2–4 sentences
* Who you are + key skills + most relevant achievements + fit for role.
* Include keywords aligned to job.

### **Work Experience**

* Reverse chronological.
* Bullet points starting with action verbs.
* Focus on **achievements**, not responsibilities.
* Quantify (%, $, time saved, volume…).
* 2–5 bullets per role (more only if highly relevant).
* Avoid internal jargon.

### **Education**

* Degree, major, institution, location, graduation year.
* GPA/honors only if helpful.
* Coursework only for early-career or field change.

### **Skills Section**

* 6–10 relevant skills; specific, not vague.
* Match job wording to job description (truthfully).
* Can group (e.g., Programming • Tools • Languages).

### **Optional Sections**

* **Certifications**, **Projects**, **Awards**, **Volunteer/Leadership**, **Interests**, **Languages** (if meaningful).
* Include only what strengthens the application.

## **3. Language & Content Principles**

* **Specific > general.** Provide context + outcome.
* **Quantify impact** whenever possible.
* **Avoid fillers:** “team player”, “hard worker”, “motivated”.
* **No irrelevant info:** age, marital status, hobbies with no value.
* **Truthful & verifiable.**
