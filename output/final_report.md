## Executive Summary üöÄ

Data Integration Snapshot
- Job analysis & scores: Overall match 0.85. Strengths in technical and soft skills, with industry alignment partial (cosmetic/defect domain experience less explicit). Key strengths include hands-on CV deployment in industrial settings, end-to-end CV pipelines, cross-functional leadership, and cloud/edge deployment experience. Gaps center on explicit cosmetic/grading domain domain experience.
- Resume optimization details: Content optimized to emphasize end-to-end CV pipeline design, development, deployment, and maintenance in industrial contexts; clarified SABIA-Mar L0 processor improvements; highlighted AI division launch and cross-domain client impact; refined intern CV bullets for clarity and alignment.
- Final resume changes: Consolidated dual Ascentio roles into clearly labeled entries; added a separate Intern entry with consistent formatting; integrated ATS-friendly keywords (see ATS section); ensured measurable impact bullets and timeframes.

Overall takeaway
- The candidate presents a strong fit for Computer Vision Engineer (Grading Applications) with an 85% overall match. Strengths in end-to-end CV pipelines, industrial deployments, leadership, and cloud/edge skills position them well for mid-senior roles. The primary next-step focus is to explicitly demonstrate cosmetic/defect-grading domain experience and quantify related achievements to close the cosmetics-domain gap.

## Next Steps üìå

Prioritized action items
1) Add cosmetics/defect-grading domain achievements with measurable metrics (e.g., defect types detected, yield improvements, defect-rate reductions).
2) Expand manufacturing/visual inspection case studies or pilots to explicitly map to cosmetic grading and quality control KPIs.
3) Ensure the resume consistently uses ATS-friendly wording across all sections; weave the ATS keyword list into capabilities, projects, and experience bullets.
4) Prepare a concise CV narrative for interviews that ties business impact (cost savings, efficiency, yield) to CV/AI capabilities.
5) Develop a portfolio of 2‚Äì3 project summaries (industrial CV pipeline, SABIA-Mar, autonomous edge pipelines) with diagrams or dashboards to discuss in interviews.

Skill development plan
- Deepen cosmetics domain expertise: enroll in short courses or certifications related to cosmetic/defect grading in manufacturing; read industry standards and typical QC metrics.
- Strengthen manufacturing-specific CV use cases: document additional projects in manufacturing/visual inspection environments; gather metrics on efficiency gains.
- Strengthen non-technical storytelling: practice translating technical CV results into business outcomes for executives and non-technical stakeholders.

Application strategy üß≠
