## Optimization Overview ‚úçÔ∏è

### Key resume improvements implemented / recommended

- Professional Summary added (2‚Äì3 sentences)
  - Emphasize: "4+ years applied ML, time-series forecasting specialist, productionization (Docker, CI/CD, FastAPI), available to provide Prophet + backtesting notebooks."
- Skills section restructured into grouped categories
  - Example groups: Time-series & Forecasting; Modeling & Deep Learning; MLOps & Deployment; Data Engineering & ETL; Monitoring & Visualization.
- Projects section (Selected Projects) added with direct GitHub links
  - Priority projects to include:
    - Time-series energy forecasting (methods, metrics, repo link).
    - Crop detection: temporal feature engineering pipeline (repo link).
    - Stock forecasting POC: Prophet + XGBoost + rolling-window backtesting (new ‚Äî repo link).
- Experience bullets rewritten to surface forecasting, validation, deployment and monitoring
  - Inline tech stack per bullet (Python, Docker, FastAPI, GitHub Actions, Airflow, Grafana).
- Achievements made concise and measurable
  - "Implemented 20+ Python improvements to SABIA-Mar L0 processor within 3 months, improving system reliability and data availability."
  - "Winner, Datathon R√≠o Cuarto 2024 ‚Äî led ETL and model improvements for LLM-based chatbot."

### ATS optimization results (estimated impact)

- Current baseline: overall_match ‚âà 77.7%; technical component ‚âà 78.1%.
- With recommended changes (Professional Summary with keywords, Projects with Prophet POC, Skills grouped and keyworded): estimated ATS keyword hit and recruiter relevance could increase by ~8‚Äì12 percentage points for job-match metrics, potentially moving the overall match into the mid-to-high 80s (estimate).
- Rationale: adding explicit "Prophet", "stock forecasting", "backtesting", and structured project links directly addresses high-weighted job keywords and the biggest domain gap.

### Impact metrics (what to expect after changes)

- Short-term (after POC + resume update): improved recruiter callbacks for forecasting roles; stronger interview invitations from fintech and time-series teams.
- Medium-term (after 1‚Äì2 finance POCs): demonstrable domain shift ‚Äî industry_match expected to rise from 0.20 ‚Üí 0.60+ depending on depth of POCs and domain narrative.
- Long-term: moving from "generalist with forecasting experience" to "specialist in temporal forecasting with finance-capable production skills".
