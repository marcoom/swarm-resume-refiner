offset by broad industrial CV experience.","Education score is favorable given ML/Data Science training and specialization; aligns with role expectations.","Industry knowledge score is moderate due to manufacturing/visual inspection domain not being cosmetics-specific; candidate shows manufacturing/industrial CV experience which provides relevant domain familiarity, but cosmetics-specific domain knowledge is not established."]}
