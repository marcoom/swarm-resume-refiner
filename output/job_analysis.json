Time-series experience is present (energy forecasting, temporal satellite analysis) but not explicitly focused on financial time-series and Prophet library usage is not shown in the resume.","Soft Skills (0.9 / 90%): Candidate demonstrates excellent product ownership, communication, cross-functional leadership and mentoring experienceâ€”well aligned with job responsibilities that require translating models into products and communicating with stakeholders.","Experience (0.85 / 85%): Candidate has ~4+ years of applied ML and production experience including leading teams and shipping ML systems. This aligns well with an expected mid-senior specialist. However, the depth of focused financial time-series work appears limited.","Education (0.9 / 90%): Strong formal education (Telecommunications Engineering), a University Diploma in Data Science, and a Machine Learning Specialization (Stanford Online). Education is well-aligned with the role.","Industry Knowledge (0.2 / 20%): Candidate has domain expertise in satellite data, remote sensing, Industry 4.0 and IoT but lacks direct financial markets / stock forecasting experience. This is the largest gap relative to the job's explicit focus on forecasting stock prices.","Key recommendation: Candidate is a promising hire for a forecasting/data-science role provided the team can either (a) accept cross-domain onboarding (teach financial domain specifics and provide datasets/backtesting frameworks) or (b) the candidate quickly demonstrates Prophet and finance-related forecasting results (sample notebook or small POC on stock data).","Suggested immediate actions if moving forward: Request a short technical assignment or notebook showing time-series forecasting on a stock-price dataset (include Prophet and at least one other approach with backtesting), and ask for explanations of model monitoring/backtesting approach to validate domain fit."]}
