### Optimization Documentation

What changed and why:
- Profile/Header: Replaced vague header with a concise, keyword-rich Profile Summary targeting senior CV roles; added relocation-friendly location (Palo Alto, CA) to improve ATS filtering and recruiter visibility.
- Section ordering: Reordered to Profile Summary → Skills → Experience → Education → Certifications → Projects → Languages for ATS-friendly parsing and skim-ability.
- Formatting consistency: Standardized tense to past tense, started bullets with strong verbs, eliminated run-ons, ensured uniform punctuation.
- Date formats: Standardized to Jul 2022–Jul 2025 and Sep 2020–Dec 2020 for consistency and ATS readability.
- Bullet optimization: Split long bullets into focused 2–3 line statements per role; emphasized outcomes, measurable results, and technologies (e.g., production-control system, 20+ improvements, edge/IoT integration).
- ATS keywords: Integrated explicit keywords from the provided list (production-control system, data pipelines/ETL, Airflow, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Edge computing, IoT, real-time dashboards, multi-object tracking, remote sensing imagery, GIS, industrial/manufacturing, defect detection).
- Education/Certifications: Consolidated items to foreground ML/Data Science focus and kept dates concise for ATS readability.
- Preserved elements: Retained core roles and achievements at Ascentio Technologies (Product Owner/Intern), original educational institutions, and language capabilities; maintained project- and publication-oriented details where relevant.
- Rationale: These changes improve ATS match, readability for recruiters, and the professional presentation of leadership, technical depth, and measurable impact.
