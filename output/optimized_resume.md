## Professional Summary
Data Scientist with 4+ years of applied ML experience specializing in time-series forecasting and production ML. Skilled in temporal feature engineering, backtesting and model evaluation (MAE, RMSE), and production deployment (Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD). Built reproducible notebooks and pipelines for energy and satellite temporal data; available to provide a Prophet + backtesting POC for financial time-series.

## Experience
### Ascentio Technologies — Product Owner, Systems Engineer | Jul 2022 – Jul 2025
Río Cuarto, Argentina
- Established the company AI division and operationalized ML capabilities (team training, production practices), enabling delivery of commercial computer-vision and Industry 4.0 projects (Python, Docker, CI/CD).
- Managed Tech Infrastructure and Science Data Processing subsystems for the SABIA-Mar mission; led roadmap and cross-functional teams up to 10 people (Agile, JIRA).
- Implemented 20+ Python improvements to the SABIA-Mar L0 data-processor within 3 months, improving system reliability and data product availability (unit tests, CI pipelines).
- Built and maintained production model serving and monitoring endpoints (FastAPI, Docker, Grafana) and ETL orchestration with Airflow; ensured observability and logging for data products.

### Ascentio Technologies — Intern (Crop detection, time-series multispectral) | Sep 2020 – Dec 2020
Río Cuarto, Argentina
- Built a Python pipeline for supervised classification over multi-spectral temporal satellite sequences, achieving 80% accuracy; implemented temporal feature extraction, rolling-window validation and documented reproducible notebooks (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
- Packaged the pipeline for reproducibility (Docker) and provided evaluation scripts for time-series metrics and backtesting.

### Faculty of Engineering, UNRC — Intern | 2018 – 2019
- Contributed to accessibility systems and prototype development; supported data collection and evaluation workflows.
