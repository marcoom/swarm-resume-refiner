Profile  
Computer vision engineer with 4+ years designing, training and deploying production CV systems (object detection, segmentation, fine-grained inspection) using PyTorch/TensorFlow, OpenCV and cloud/edge deployments. Experienced owning image pipelines (acquisition → annotation → training → deployment) with Apache Airflow, Dockerized model serving (FastAPI), CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and edge inference (MQTT, Raspberry Pi, accelerators). Strong product ownership, cross-functional leadership and stakeholder communication.

## Experience

### Product Owner, Systems Engineer — Ascentio Technologies, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
July 2022 — July 2025
- Founded and launched the company's artificial-intelligence division; transferred expertise via training and documentation, enabling new client engagements in computer vision and Industry 4.0.  
- Designed and deployed an end-to-end computer-vision production-control system for an industrial plant (multi-object detection & tracking) using YOLO-family detectors and DeepSORT for tracking; led rollout and ongoing operations as product owner.  
- Integrated edge inference stack (Dockerized FastAPI model servers → AWS ECR/EC2 or on‑prem images), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and monitoring dashboards (Grafana/Prometheus) to ensure reliable production serving and alerting.  
- Architected ETL for image data collection and preprocessing; orchestrated annotation workflows and automated training pipelines with Apache Airflow to reduce iteration time between data collection and model retraining.  
- Coordinated with product managers, operations and QA to define acceptance criteria, rollout schedule and KPIs; presented system status at Critical Design Reviews for SABIA‑Mar stakeholders.  
- Implemented >20 improvements to the L0 processor for the SABIA‑Mar satellite mission in Python, meeting client requirements within tight deadlines.  
- Managed cross-functional teams up to 10 engineers and researchers; mentored junior staff and led technical reviews.

### Intern — Ascentio Technologies, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
September 2020 — December 2020
- Developed an automatic crop-detection platform in Python using supervised classification over multi-spectral time series (≈80% accuracy).

### Intern — Faculty of Engineering, UNRC, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
2018 — 2019
- Contributed to accessibility systems and implementation projects (hardware/software integration).

## Selected Projects (CV-focused)
- Real-time license-plate detection pipeline — YOLOv8 + DeepSORT + OCR; Dockerized, real-time stream, deployed prototype with FastAPI and demo UI.  
- Automated blood-cell counting prototype — YOLO detection + SAM2 segmentation; containerized inference, Gradio UI, documented reproduction steps.  
- Defect & cosmetic grading prototype — fine-grained classification + segmentation for surface defects; includes experiments on label-noise mitigation (consensus labeling, label smoothing, simple uncertainty estimation) and HITL validation workflows.  
- Image ETL & training orchestration — Apache Airflow pipelines for large image datasets, automated annotation handoff, preprocessing (normalization, augmentation, contrast enhancement) and scheduled retraining.
