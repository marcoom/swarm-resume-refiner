## Professional Summary
Data Scientist specializing in time-series forecasting and production ML. Skilled in temporal feature engineering, backtesting and model evaluation (MAE, RMSE), and production deployment (Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD). Built reproducible notebooks and pipelines for energy and satellite temporal data; developed a Prophet + backtesting POC for stock forecasting.

## Experience
### Ascentio Technologies — Product Owner, Systems Engineer | Jul 2022 – Jul 2025
Río Cuarto, Argentina
- Launched the company AI division and transferred expertise to the team, enabling delivery of commercial computer-vision and Industry 4.0 projects (Python, Docker, CI/CD).
- Managed Technological Infrastructure and Science Data Processing subsystems for the SABIA-Mar mission; led roadmap and cross-functional teams of up to 10 people (Agile, JIRA).
- Implemented over 20 Python improvements to the SABIA-Mar L0 data-processor within a 3-month timeframe, improving system reliability and fulfilling client-required functionalities.
- Led end-to-end delivery of a computer-vision production-control system for an industrial plant, covering design, production rollout and ongoing maintenance (edge computing, IoT protocols, dashboards).

### Ascentio Technologies — Intern (Crop detection, time-series multispectral) | Sep 2020 – Dec 2020
Río Cuarto, Argentina
- Developed a Python pipeline for supervised classification over multi-spectral temporal satellite sequences, achieving ~80% accuracy; implemented temporal feature extraction, rolling-window validation and documented reproducible notebooks (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
- Packaged the pipeline for reproducibility (Docker) and provided evaluation scripts for time-series metrics and backtesting.

### Faculty of Engineering, UNRC — Intern | 2018 – 2019
- Contributed to accessibility systems and prototype development for the project "Improving university campus accessibility – Hearingloops"; implemented systems to enhance hearing for people with impairments and supported data collection and evaluation workflows.
