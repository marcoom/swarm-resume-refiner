## Experience

### Product Owner, Systems Engineer — Ascentio Technologies, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
July 2022 — July 2025
- Managed teams of up to 10 people as Product Owner and Systems Engineer, leading the Technological Infrastructure and Science Data Processing subsystems of the SABIA‑Mar satellite mission.  
- Launched the company's artificial-intelligence division; transferred expertise to the team through training and documentation, enabling new client engagements in computer vision and Industry 4.0.  
- Led end-to-end a computer-vision production-control system for an industrial plant, covering design, production rollout and ongoing maintenance (multi-object detection & tracking, edge computing, IoT protocols and real-time dashboards).  
- Implemented over 20 improvements to the L0 processor of the SABIA‑Mar satellite mission in Python, fulfilling client-required functionalities within a 3-month timeframe.  
- Coordinated with product managers, operations and QA; presented system status during the Critical Design Review of the SABIA‑Mar mission.

### Intern — Ascentio Technologies, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
September 2020 — December 2020
- Developed a platform for automatic crop detection in Python, achieving ~80% accuracy using supervised classification on multi-spectral time series.

### Intern — Faculty of Engineering, UNRC, Río Cuarto, Argentina  
2018 — 2019
- Contributed to the project "Improving university campus accessibility – Hearing loops", implementing systems to enhance hearing for people with impairments.
