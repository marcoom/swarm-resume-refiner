## Applicant Strength & Gaps üîé
- Strengths ‚úÖ
  - End-to-end industrial CV delivery: detection/tracking, edge/IoT, real-time dashboards, production integration.
  - Strong Python and DL stack: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras; multiple deployed projects.
  - OpenCV and image preprocessing foundation; robust pipeline design (acquisition ‚Üí training).
  - Cross-functional leadership and communication (software/QA/hardware; English C1/C2).
  - Cloud exposure (AWS/GCP) and MLOps (CI/CD, containers, testing).

- Gaps ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Limited direct experience in cosmetic grading for mobile devices.
  - Minimal explicit use of annotation inconsistency methods (soft labels, consensus, uncertainty, HITL).
  - Slightly below 4+ years in production CV (‚âà3 years).
  - Less emphasis on segmentation-heavy micro-defect localization.

## Resume Optimizations Implemented ‚ú®
- Header: Standardized full, ATS-friendly URLs and clean separators for contact links.
- Summary: Added a targeted 3‚Äì4 line profile aligned to cosmetic/defect grading and industrial visual inspection.
- Work Experience: Rewrote bullets with action/results; emphasized visual/quality inspection, pipelines, edge deployment, and production rollout.
- Skills: Consolidated into ATS-friendly categories; prioritized CV, DL (PyTorch/TensorFlow), MLOps, Cloud, Edge/IoT.
- ATS Formatting: Fixed spacing/case; standardized headings and dates; single-column layout; plain bullets.
- Projects: Prioritized inspection-relevant work (detection+segmentation pipelines; real-time systems); trimmed generic items.
- Soft Skills: Condensed to core competencies relevant to cross-functional collaboration and ownership.
- Certifications & Training: Standardized title, consistent, reverse-chronological listing.
- Presentations & Awards: Split into clear sections with concise entries.
- Low-Value Items: Removed hobby hardware, vague ‚Äúhigh-concurrency,‚Äù and redundant English proficiency from Skills.
- Academic Publications: Compressed to single-line entries near the end.
- File & Links: Professional file naming; ensured LinkedIn/GitHub links are complete and highlight key CV projects.
- ATS Keywords added: visual inspection; quality inspection; fine-grained classification; image preprocessing (normalization, augmentation, contrast enhancement); segmentation; object detection; OpenCV; PyTorch; TensorFlow/Keras; edge deployment; IoT (MQTT); CI/CD (GitHub Actions); Docker; Kubernetes; AWS; Apache Airflow; ETL pipelines; production integration; cross-functional collaboration; cosmetic grading (target domain).
